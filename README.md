# bamazon

*bamazon* is a CLI app resembling a store, similar to amazon.
  * Users are initially prompted with the options of choosing from a list of items.
  * The user is then asked how much of that item they'd like to purchase.
  * If the user's choice amount is great than the available stock, a message will display saying such.
  * After inputting the amount, a confirmation message is displayed.
  * mySQL updates the database with the user's choice.
  * A final prompt will display, asking whether the user would like to continue, or end the program.
